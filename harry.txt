In the Harry Potter series, there are several secret passageways that lead in and out of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry: 
Marauder's Map: Fred and George Weasley give Harry the Marauder's Map in Prisoner of Azkaban, which lists seven secret exits. However, the map is incomplete and there are more passages that become relevant in later books.
Danger levels: The passages vary in danger levels, from risky to very dangerous.
Creativity: The passages are a great example of the series's creativity and sometimes help to emphasize Harry Potter's central themes.
