Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a magical institution from the Harry Potter series, founded over a thousand years ago. Located in Scotland, it trains young witches and wizards in subjects like Potions, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. The school houses students in four houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw.
Hogwarts is a large, rambling castle that is protected by magic and enchantments. It's difficult to get into or out of the school undetected, as wizards can't teleport into the castle. Those who try to enter or exit on foot must face magical barriers, deadly creatures, and Severus Snape.
